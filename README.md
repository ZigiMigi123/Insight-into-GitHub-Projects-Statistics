    //Purpose of this app//
- This app uses GitHub API token and gets youm, for a start, 3 different metadata from GitHub project:
- This app can get you number of stargazes, so you can see how many likes the project has on GitHub, without looking on the website.
- It gets you latest commits. (The latest commits score is based on the current week as the API token refreshes the numbers every week.)
- It gets you number of contributors.
The project is built for my college degree purpose and it was my final project to build in order to graduate from filed Programming. It was a fun app to build and i really learned a lot.
----> I know that this project is more then a bigginer project but hey, i am in programming for almost 2 years now. This app needs tons of new features that i will sometime in the future do.
Feel free to experimente and if you have any great ideas just play around and let me see what you have build from it :)
